# U.S. Weather Trends

This data visualization displays weather trends for 10 U.S. cities from July 2014 to June 2015. The chart shows the distribution of actual average temperatures for each month using density curves. This project was created as a part of INFO 474 (Interactive Information Visualization) at the University of Washington. 

## Features
* Temperature distribution: The density curves show the distribution of actual average temperatures for each month. 
* Hover over data: The user can hover over each data point to see the average, min, and max temperature for that month. This feature provides a more detailed view of the data and allows the user to explore the temperature trends for each month.
* Monthly data: The y-axis displays the months, allowing the user to view temperature trends over time.

## Instructions
1. View the temperature distribution for each month using the density curves.
2. Hover over each data point to see the average, min, and max temperature for that month.

## Technical details
This data visualization was created using D3.js and JavaScript. The temperature data was sourced from Wunderground for multiple U.S. cities. The initial ridgeline plots for this project were borrowed from the [D3.js Graph Library](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/ridgeline_basic.html). The code for this project is available on this Github repository.
